Tutorial 11 (Lung, MGN): Score Predicted Lung Motion Per Lobe

Purpose
-------
Measures how close the size and shape of the lung inferred by Tutorial 10 are to
the lung actually imaged, one respiratory phase at a time and one lobe at a
time.  The case is ``ParametersLungCTDirLab.mgn_hold_out_case``, held out of the
Tutorial 9 training, so this scores generalization rather than recall.

1. Build the ground truth: segment every gated CT frame of the case
   independently, giving one labelmap per respiratory phase whose lobes were
   never seen by the shape model or by the network.

2. Score the prediction: :class:`physiotwin4d.WorkflowEvaluateMovement` carries
   the reference phase's labelmap into every other phase with the network's own
   deformation, and compares the result to that phase's segmentation --- volume
   difference and surface RMSE per lobe.  Dice is left out: a lobe barely
   changes shape over a breath compared to how big it is, so the overlap
   fraction stays above 0.96 however well or badly the motion is predicted, and
   describes the lobe rather than the motion.

3. Score the motion point by point: with Tutorial 8's per-phase SSM surfaces as
   the ground truth, the report also carries the distance between where the
   network puts each mesh point and where the shape model fitted it --- RMS,
   95th percentile and maximum, per lobe and per phase.  The lung shape model
   tags every triangle with its lobe, so a mesh point is scored under the lobe
   the model itself says it belongs to.  A lobe whose predicted motion is right on average can
   still be wrong everywhere, and only this measure says so.

4. Write ``evaluation_report.md`` and ``evaluation_metrics.csv``, both carrying
   the hold-out case name, the case's shape parameters, and the network weights
   path with its dates.  Each metric is reported both averaged over the phases
   and at the phase it is worst at.

Step 1 costs one segmentation pass per phase on first run and is cached
afterwards; Steps 2 to 4 are the workflow, so this script only chooses the case,
the lobes and the ground truth.

Extra Install Required
----------------------
PhysicsNeMo and PyTorch Geometric must be installed::

    pip install "physiotwin4d[physicsnemo]"

Data Required
-------------
  * ``data/DirLab-4DCT/<case>_T??.mha``  - the gated CT sequence
  * ``output/tutorial_08_lung/<case>/``  - Tutorial 8 fit + phase transforms
  * ``network_weights/physicsnemo_mgn_lung_motion/`` - Tutorial 9 checkpoint

The Tutorial 8 anatomy is automatically refitted to the PCA domain bundled
with the checkpoint and cached under
``output/tutorial_08_lung_checkpoint/<case>/``. The original Tutorial 6 and 8
outputs are not overwritten.

Outputs (under ``output/tutorial_11_lung/<case>/``)
---------------------------------------------------
  * ``evaluation_report.md``    - per-lobe accuracy of the prediction, mean and
    worst case, with the per-point displacement error per phase
  * ``evaluation_metrics.csv``  - one row per stage and lobe, each carrying
    that lobe's displacement error (RMS, 95th percentile, maximum)
  * ``volume_vs_stage.png``     - each lobe's volume across the stages
  * ``ground_truth/<case>_T{PP}_labelmap.nii.gz`` - cached per-phase segmentation
  * ``<case>_ssm_pca_coefficients_s{TTT}_pred.vtp`` - predicted surface per stage,
    carrying the displacement point-data arrays the ``include_*`` switches ask for
  * ``displacement_per_point.csv`` - every mesh point's predicted and true
    displacement at every phase; written only when ``report_displacement_data``
