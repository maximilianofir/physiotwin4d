     <h1>From a CT scan to an animated digital twin</h1>
     <p>
       Fifteen numbered stages across 33 Python scripts, 21 of them runnable
       today: the twelve <code>duke_heart</code> variants wait on a dataset
       that is being released soon.
       Each one drives the real workflow classes end-to-end on downloadable
       data, shows what it produced, and ends with the handful of constants
       to change so it runs on your own scans.
     </p>
   </section>

Before You Start
================

**1. Get the scripts.** They ship with the source repository, not with the pip
package — ``pip install physiotwin4d`` gives you the library and the
``physiotwin4d-*`` commands but no ``tutorials/`` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Project-MONAI/physiotwin4d.git
   cd physiotwin4d

See :doc:`quickstart` for version-matched clones and the release tarball link.

**2. Get the data**, running every download from the top level of the clone.
The tutorials resolve their inputs against the repository root
(``<repo>/data/<dataset>``), while the CLI writes to ``data/<dataset>``
relative to the current working directory:

.. code-block:: bash

   physiotwin4d-download-data Slicer-Heart-CT --directory data/Slicer-Heart-CT
   physiotwin4d-download-data KCL-Heart-Model --directory data/KCL-Heart-Model
   physiotwin4d-download-data Chest-CT --directory data/Chest-CT

That covers Heart Tutorials 1, 3, 4 and 6 (``Slicer-Heart-CT`` and
``KCL-Heart-Model``) and Lung Tutorial 7 (``Chest-CT``), which Tutorial 13 also
animates. ``DirLab-4DCT`` — used by Lung Tutorials 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11 and
12, and by Heart Tutorial 7 — is **not** auto-downloaded: DIR-Lab distributes
each case individually and may require registration.

Tutorials 5 and 9 need no dataset of their own; they consume the outputs of
Tutorials 4 and 8. ``Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps`` drives the twelve ``duke_heart``
variants: an eleven-tutorial chain from Tutorial 4 through Tutorial 15, plus
the separate, optional Tutorial 2 ICON finetuning variant; the dataset is
being released soon, and until then access can be requested from Stephen Aylward
(saylward@nvidia.com). See ``data/DirLab-4DCT/README.md``,
``data/Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps/README.md``, and
:doc:`cli_scripts/download_data` for every dataset's size and source.

**3. Know where output lands.** Every tutorial writes to
``tutorials/output/<tutorial_name>/`` and reuses what it finds there, so a
second run is cheap and later tutorials pick up earlier results automatically.

Recommended Run Order
=====================

Tutorials are straightforward Python scripts: run one with
``python tutorials/tutorial_01_heart_gated_ct_to_usd.py``, or open it in your
editor and read it top to bottom. Numbers 1, 4 and 5 are the fastest way to see
the toolkit
work end-to-end; 6 through 15 build the statistical-model and AI-surrogate
pipeline on top.

1. **Tutorial 1** — after downloading Slicer-Heart-CT.
2. **Tutorial 2** — after obtaining DIR-Lab. It writes the finetuned ICON
   weights Tutorial 8 uses when present; optional if stock weights are
   acceptable.
3. **Tutorial 3** — after obtaining its dataset; it registers with Greedy and
   needs no finetuned weights.
4. **Tutorial 4** — after downloading Slicer-Heart-CT.
5. **Tutorial 5** — after Tutorial 4, whose surfaces it converts.
6. **Tutorial 6** — heart needs KCL-Heart-Model, lung needs DIR-Lab.
7. **Tutorial 7** — after Tutorial 6; the lung variant also needs Chest-CT.
8. **Tutorial 8** — after Tutorial 6 (lung); Tutorial 2 optional.
9. **Tutorial 9** — after Tutorial 8, whose fitted meshes it trains on.
10. **Tutorial 10** — after Tutorial 9, whose checkpoint it loads.
11. **Tutorial 11** — after Tutorial 9. The lung variant segments every gated
    frame of the held-out case, so it needs a GPU and the segmentation weights.
12. **Tutorial 12** — after Tutorial 6 and Tutorial 9 for its anatomy; it fits
    the model to the patient itself, so nothing is read from Tutorial 8.
13. **Tutorial 13** — after Tutorial 7 (lung) and Tutorial 9 for both anatomies.
    It also needs Simpleware Medical, which segments the heart it fits.
14. **Tutorial 14** — after Tutorial 8 and Tutorial 9, whose fit and
    checkpoint every point of the grid reuses. It scores each point the way
    Tutorial 11 does, so it needs a GPU and the segmentation weights too.
15. **Tutorial 15** — needs only the cohort. It rebuilds the shape model, the
    fits and the network per fold, so nothing from Tutorials 6, 8 or 9 is read;
    those outputs are reused as a cache when they happen to be there.

Tutorial 1: Gated 4D CT to Animated USD
=======================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_01_heart_gated_ct_to_usd.py`` (Slicer-Heart-CT)

   ``tutorials/tutorial_01_lung_gated_ct_to_usd.py`` (DIR-Lab)

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertImageToUSD`, driving
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterImagesGreedy` and a
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentAnatomyBase` subclass.

Dataset
   Slicer-Heart-CT (auto-download) for the heart, DIR-Lab (manual) for the
   lung. The phase roughly 70% through the series is the segmentation and
   registration reference.

Requirements
   Greedy registers every phase against the reference on the CPU; a GPU is
   still needed for segmentation.

      :alt: Animated cardiac USD produced by Tutorial 1
      :width: 90%

   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_01_lung_4d.gif
      :alt: Animated lung USD produced by Tutorial 1
      :width: 90%

      The same workflow on a DIR-Lab respiratory series.

Inner API usage
   .. code-block:: python

      workflow = WorkflowConvertImageToUSD(
          time_series_images=time_series_images,
          reference_image=reference_image,
          output_directory=str(output_dir),
          usd_project_name="cardiac_model",
          registration_method=registration_method,
          segmentation_method=segmentation_method,
          save_assets=True,
      )
      workflow_results = workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_01_heart_gated_ct_to_usd.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_01_lung_gated_ct_to_usd.py

Outputs
   The animated USD named after ``usd_project_name``, the per-phase registered
   volumes and labelmaps, and screenshots — all under
   ``tutorials/output/tutorial_01_{heart,lung}/``.

Adapt to your data
   Point ``data_dir`` and the file glob near the top of the script at your own
   series: any set of 3D volumes ITK can read (``.mha``, ``.nrrd``,
   ``.nii.gz``) in acquisition order, or a 4D ``.seq.nrrd`` split first with
   ``physiotwin4d-convert-image-4d-to-3d``. Choose the reference phase by
   changing the index expression, and swap ``segmentation_method`` for the one
   matching your anatomy and contrast — see :doc:`api/segmentation/index`. For
   command-line use without editing code, run
   ``physiotwin4d-convert-image-to-usd`` (:doc:`cli_scripts/heart_gated_ct`).

Tutorial 2: Finetune ICON Registration
======================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_02_lung_finetune_icon.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_02_lung_distancemap_finetune_icon.py`` — the lung
   distance-map variant, which finetunes on distance maps rather than image
   intensities so the labelmap-to-labelmap stage of Tutorials 7 and 8 has
   in-distribution weights.

   ``tutorials/tutorial_02_duke_heart_distancemap_finetune_icon.py`` — the same
   for the heart, on Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps. The heart needs its own run because
   it registers with a much tighter mask than the lungs, so its distance maps
   saturate over a shorter radius and do not share an intensity distribution
   with lung ones. The per-organ values live in
   ``tutorials/parameters_lung_ct_dirlab.py`` for the lung variant and
   ``tutorials/parameters_duke_heart_labelmaps.py`` for this one. This is a
   ``duke_heart`` tutorial: Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps is being released soon (see
   `Before You Start`_), and until then access can be requested from Stephen
   Aylward (saylward@nvidia.com) — see
   ``data/Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps/README.md``.

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowFinetuneICONRegistration`, then
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterImagesGreedy` and
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterImagesGreedyICON` to score the result, with
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentNVSegmentCTMRI` supplying the labelmaps.

Dataset
   DIR-Lab (manual). Every case except ``Case1Pack`` trains; ``Case1Pack`` is
   held out and registered three ways — Greedy alone with its defaults, then
   Greedy+ICON with the stock uniGradICON weights and with the finetuned ones —
   so the improvement is measured, not asserted.

Scoring
   The fixed image is segmented once, and each registered moving image is
   segmented again after warping. The table reports the mean, 5th percentile,
   median, 95th percentile, minimum and maximum of the per-class Dice scores,
   plus the mislabeled voxel count, with the unregistered moving image as a
   reference row. Segmenting each warped volume separately costs one GPU
   segmentation per method and folds segmentation variability into the scores.

Requirements
   GPU required. 100 epochs over nine cases: the longest-running tutorial
   before the AI-surrogate chain. The experiment directory is cleared on every
   run, so it does not resume.

Preview
   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_02_finetuning.png
      :alt: Registration accuracy table for the held-out case
      :width: 100%

      The held-out case scored per method — unregistered, Greedy, Greedy+ICON
      with the stock weights, and with the finetuned weights.

Inner API usage
   .. code-block:: python

      workflow = WorkflowFinetuneICONRegistration(
          subject_image_files=list(subject_image_files.values()),
          output_dir=weights_dir,
          finetune_name=finetune_name,
          subject_ids=list(subject_image_files.keys()),
          epochs=epochs,
          dice_loss_weight=0.0,
      )
      weights_path = workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_02_lung_finetune_icon.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_02_lung_distancemap_finetune_icon.py

Outputs
   The finetuned checkpoint under
   ``tutorials/network_weights/icon_dirlab_4dct/``, plus
   ``registration_summary.csv``, the fixed-minus-registered difference images
   (residual structure is what separates the methods), the fixed and warped
   labelmaps, and before/after screenshots in
   ``tutorials/output/tutorial_02_lung/``.

Adapt to your data
   Replace the training cohort glob with your own volumes and set ``epochs``
   to fit your budget — the workflow needs only a list of image files and
   matching subject ids. Raise ``dice_loss_weight`` above ``0.0`` when you also
   have labelmaps to supervise with. Load the resulting weights anywhere by
   passing them to :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterImagesICON`.

Tutorial 3: Reconstruct High-Resolution 4D CT
=============================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_03_heart_reconstruct_highres_4d_ct.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_03_lung_reconstruct_highres_4d_ct.py``

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowReconstructHighres4DCT` with
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterImagesGreedy`.

Dataset
   Slicer-Heart-CT for the heart; DIR-Lab for the lung, which reconstructs
   against its T70 (end-exhale) phase — the same reference Tutorial 8 fits to.

Requirements
   CPU is enough. One coarse-to-fine registration per phase, greedy schedule
   ``[30, 15, 7, 3]``.

Inner API usage
   .. code-block:: python

      registration_method = RegisterImagesGreedy()
      registration_method.set_number_of_iterations([30, 15, 7, 3])

      workflow = WorkflowReconstructHighres4DCT(
          time_series_images=time_series,
          reference_image=reference_image,
          reference_time_frame=reference_time_frame,
          registration_method=registration_method,
      )
      workflow.set_modality("ct")
      result = workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_03_heart_reconstruct_highres_4d_ct.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_03_lung_reconstruct_highres_4d_ct.py

Outputs
   ``reconstructed_frame_<i>.mha`` plus forward and inverse transforms for
   every phase, and two screenshots, under
   ``tutorials/output/tutorial_03_{heart,lung}/``.

Adapt to your data
   Set ``case_glob`` and ``data_dir`` to your series and pick the reference
   with ``reference_time_frame``. If you have a separate breath-hold or
   contrast-enhanced volume, pass it as ``reference_image`` instead of one of
   the phases — that is what the workflow is really designed for. Tune
   ``number_of_iterations_greedy`` down for a fast smoke test. The saved
   ``.hdf`` transforms are reusable:
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.TransformTools` applies them to meshes and labelmaps.

Tutorial 4: CT Segmentation to VTK Surfaces
===========================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_04_heart_ct_to_vtk.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_04_lung_ct_to_vtk.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_04_duke_heart_labelmap_to_vtk.py`` — starts from gated
   labelmaps rather than CT, and also extracts tetrahedral meshes. Needs
   Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertImageToVTK` with
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentChestTotalSegmentatorWithContrast` (heart) or
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentChestTotalSegmentator` (lung).

Dataset
   One frame of Slicer-Heart-CT or DIR-Lab — a single static volume is enough.

Requirements
   GPU recommended for segmentation; no registration, so this is the quickest
   way to confirm your environment and model weights work.

   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_04_duke_heart.png
      :alt: Heart surfaces extracted from a gated Duke labelmap
      :width: 90%

      The ``duke_heart`` variant, which starts from a gated labelmap rather than
      a CT and also writes tetrahedral meshes.

Inner API usage
   .. code-block:: python

      workflow = WorkflowConvertImageToVTK(
          segmentation_method=segmentation_method,
      )
      result = workflow.process(
          input_image=ct_image,
          surface_reduction_rate=HEART_CT_KCL.surface_reduction_rate,
          extract_label_surfaces=save_label_surfaces,
      )

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_04_heart_ct_to_vtk.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_04_lung_ct_to_vtk.py

Outputs
   ``patient_surfaces.vtp`` (all anatomy in one mesh, with a per-cell
   ``SegmentationLabelIds`` array so each cell still names the structure it came
   from), per-group and per-label ``.vtp`` files, ``patient_labelmap.mha`` and
   two screenshots, under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_04_{heart,lung}/``.

Adapt to your data
   Change the input volume path, then choose the segmenter matching your scan:
   contrast versus non-contrast CT, or
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentNVSegmentCTMRI` for CT **and** MRI. Raise
   ``surface_reduction_rate`` in the tutorial's parameter module toward ``1.0``
   for lighter meshes. Every
   segmenter declares its own labels through
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.AnatomyTaxonomy`, so downstream grouping and USD
   materials follow automatically — see :doc:`api/segmentation/index`.

Tutorial 5: VTK Surfaces to Animated USD
========================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_05_heart_vtk_to_usd.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_05_duke_heart_vtk_to_usd.py`` — the 4D counterpart,
   animating Tutorial 4 (duke heart)'s per-phase surfaces. Needs
   Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertVTKToUSD`.

Dataset
   Tutorial 4's per-structure ``patient_*.vtp`` surfaces — no image data, no
   download.

Requirements
   CPU only, seconds to run. The cheapest tutorial in the set.

          static_merge=True,
          separate_by_connectivity=True,
      )
      results = workflow.process()

   Each input surface keeps the structure name that
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertImageToVTK` wrote into its
   ``field_data['SegmentationLabelNames']``. That name becomes the USD prim
   name and, with ``anatomy_type`` left unset, selects the prim's material —
   so the left chambers, right chambers, myocardium and great vessels each get
   their own look rather than one shared heart material.

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_05_heart_vtk_to_usd.py

Outputs
   The USD scene and a rendered screenshot under
   ``tutorials/output/tutorial_05_heart/``.

Adapt to your data
   ``input_meshes`` takes any list of PyVista meshes — pass one per time point,
   in order, for an animated scene instead of a static one (drop
   ``static_merge``), and set ``frames_per_second`` to control playback.
   ``appearance="anatomy"`` binds per-organ materials through
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.USDAnatomyTools`; set ``anatomy_type`` to force one
   palette onto every object, or ``object_names`` to name the prims yourself.
   For file-in, file-out conversion without Python, see
   :doc:`cli_scripts/vtk_to_usd`.

Tutorial 6: Create a PCA Shape Model
====================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_06_heart_create_statistical_model.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_06_lung_create_statistical_model.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_06_duke_heart_create_statistical_model.py`` — builds the
   cardiac model the ``duke_heart`` surrogate chain trains against. Needs
   Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowCreateStatisticalModel`; the lung variant
   first builds an unbiased atlas with
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowCreateMeanSurface`.

Dataset
   KCL-Heart-Model (auto-download) for the heart. The lung variant starts from
   raw DIR-Lab volumes, segmenting each case's T70 phase itself.

Requirements
   The heart variant is CPU-only and quick. **The lung variant is the slowest
   of Tutorials 1-7**: one GPU segmentation per case, then a deformable
   registration per case per atlas iteration. Every intermediate is cached, so
   a re-run costs almost nothing.

      mean_workflow.set_number_of_iterations(mean_surface_iterations)
      reference_surface = mean_workflow.process()["mean_surface"]

      workflow = WorkflowCreateStatisticalModel(
          sample_meshes=sample_surfaces,
          reference_mesh=reference_surface,
          number_of_pca_components=number_of_pca_components,
      )
      result = workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_06_heart_create_statistical_model.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_06_lung_create_statistical_model.py

Outputs
   ``pca_model.json``, ``pca_mean_surface.vtp``, the ±2σ mode surfaces and
   their renders, under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_06_{heart,lung}/``. The
   lung variant also leaves its per-case segmentations there, which Tutorial 8
   reuses.

Adapt to your data
   The workflow wants a population of meshes plus one reference; point
   ``sample_meshes`` at your own cohort and let
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowCreateMeanSurface` build the reference when no
   natural template exists. ``number_of_pca_components`` trades fidelity
   against cohort size — you need more subjects than modes. The saved
   ``pca_model.json`` is the portable artifact: Tutorials 7 and 8 and
   :doc:`cli_scripts/create_statistical_model` all speak it.

Tutorial 7: Fit the Shape Model to a Patient
============================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_07_heart_fit_statistical_model_to_patient.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_07_lung_fit_statistical_model_to_patient.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_07_duke_heart_fit_statistical_model_to_patient.py`` —
   fits the Tutorial 6 (duke heart) model. Needs Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see
   `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient`.

Dataset
   Tutorial 6's model plus one patient scan. The lung variant fits to
   ``Chest-CT`` — an ungated, single-acquisition chest CT, the kind a
   patient-specific model is normally fitted to. See
   ``data/Chest-CT/README.md`` for the data source and required citation.

Requirements
   One segmentation pass plus a PCA-constrained fit; GPU recommended for the
   segmentation, and no registration over time.

Preview
   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_07_heart_in_noncontrast_ct.gif
      :alt: Fitted heart model overlaid on a non-contrast CT

          template_model=pca_mean,
          patient_models=[patient_surface],
          patient_image=patient_image,
          patient_labelmap=patient_labelmap,
      )
      workflow.set_use_pca_registration(
          use_pca_registration=True,
          pca_model=pca_model,
      )
      result = workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_07_heart_fit_statistical_model_to_patient.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_07_lung_fit_statistical_model_to_patient.py

Outputs
   The registered template surface, the fitted mesh, and — the piece the rest
   of the pipeline needs — ``*_registered_coefficients.json``, the patient's
   position in shape space. Under
   ``tutorials/output/tutorial_07_{heart,lung}/``.

Adapt to your data
   Set the patient image path and keep the segmenter consistent with the one
   that built the model. ``labelmap_interior_object_ids`` (heart) tells the fit
   which labels are interior structures — those ids are TotalSegmentator's
   chamber labels, so change them if you change segmenter. Turn
   ``set_use_pca_registration`` off to fall back to an unconstrained
   template-to-patient fit when you have no model. The CLI equivalent is
   :doc:`cli_scripts/fit_statistical_model_to_patient`.

Tutorial 8: Propagate the Shape Model Through 4D
================================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_08_lung_fit_model_to_4d_patients.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_08_duke_heart_fit_model_to_4d_patients.py`` — the same
   fit-then-propagate pass over cardiac phases, using
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.RegisterModelsDistanceMaps` in place of the image
   registration. Needs Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient` at the reference
   phase, then :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowReconstructHighres4DCT` to carry
   the fitted surface through every other phase.

Dataset
   DIR-Lab, plus Tutorial 6 (lung)'s model. Tutorial 2's finetuned distance-map
   ICON weights are used by the model fit when present; without them the
   tutorial warns and fits with the stock uniGradICON weights.

Requirements
   GPU required, and the heaviest registration workload in the set: one
   segmentation and one fit per case, plus one registration per phase per case.

Preview
   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_08_lung.gif
      :alt: Fitted lung shape model carried through every respiratory phase

          template_model=pca_mean_surface,
          patient_models=[lung_surface],
          patient_image=reference_image,
          patient_labelmap=lung_labelmap,
      )
      fit_workflow.set_use_pca_registration(True, pca_model=pca_model)

      reg_workflow = WorkflowReconstructHighres4DCT(
          time_series_images=time_series,
          reference_image=reference_image,
          reference_time_frame=phase_ids.index(reference_phase),
          register_reference_time_frame_to_reference_image=False,
          registration_method=registration_method,
      )

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_08_lung_fit_model_to_4d_patients.py

Outputs
   Per case, under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_08_lung/<case>/``: the fitted
   reference surface, its PCA coefficients, and one warped surface plus
   forward/inverse transform per phase. Those per-phase surfaces are exactly
   the training set Tutorial 9 consumes.

Adapt to your data
   Point ``data_dir`` at a directory of per-case 4D series and set
   ``reference_phase`` to the phase your model was built at; the case and phase
   file patterns are two globs near the top of the script. Everything is cached
   per case, so adding a subject re-runs only that subject.

Tutorial 9: Train a PhysicsNeMo Surrogate
=========================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_09_lung_train_physicsnemo_mgn.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_09_duke_heart_train_physicsnemo_mgn.py`` — trains the
   cardiac network Tutorial 13 uses for its heartbeat. Needs
   Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowTrainPhysicsNeMo` driving
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.TrainPhysicsNeMoMGN`, then
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferPhysicsNeMo` and
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferMovement` to score the held-out case. A
   fully connected :class:`~physiotwin4d.TrainPhysicsNeMoMLP` method is a
   drop-in replacement; no separate tutorial ships for it.

Dataset
   Tutorial 8's per-phase surfaces and Tutorial 6 (lung)'s mean surface. The
   tutorial writes one JSON manifest per case, plus the per-vertex displacement
   targets those manifests point at.

Requirements
   GPU, plus the optional extra::

      pip install "physiotwin4d[physicsnemo]"
      pip install torch-geometric

   Python >= 3.11. 1500 epochs by default.

          output_directory=output_dir,
          training_method=training_method,
      )
      train_result = train_workflow.process()

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_09_lung_train_physicsnemo_mgn.py

Outputs
   ``mgn_stage_model.pt``, its metadata and loss/RMSE logs, in the shared
   weights directory Tutorial 10 reads
   (``tutorials/network_weights/physicsnemo_mgn_lung_motion/``, a fresh sibling
   of it when resuming). The per-case manifests and the held-out evaluation
   under ``eval_mgn/`` stay in ``tutorials/output/tutorial_09_lung_mgn/``.

Adapt to your data
   The contract is the manifest, not the tutorial. Each JSON names a reference
   mesh, a PCA coefficient file, a ``target_array`` name and one entry per
   phase; the workflow reads that array verbatim, so the target can be
   displacement — as here — or any per-point quantity of any width. Produce
   manifests in that shape from your own pipeline and nothing else changes.
   See :doc:`api/physicsnemo/index` for the schema, and
   :doc:`cli_scripts/train_physicsnemo` for the command-line path.

Tutorial 10: Predict Motion With the Surrogate
==============================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_10_lung_infer_physicsnemo_mgn.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_10_duke_heart_infer_physicsnemo_mgn.py`` — the same
   prediction over a cardiac cycle. Needs Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps (see
   `Before You Start`_).

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferPhysicsNeMo` for the raw prediction,
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferMovement` to turn it back into geometry,
   and :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertVTKToUSD` to export it.

Dataset
   Tutorial 8's fitted surfaces for one case, and Tutorial 9's checkpoint.

Requirements
   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra; otherwise trivial — one forward pass per stage
   replaces the per-phase registration solve that produced the training data.

Preview
   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_10_lung_motion_usd.gif
      :alt: Animated USD of the predicted lung motion

          epoch=epoch,

          usd_project_name=f"{case_id}_mgn_motion",
          anatomy_type="lung",
      )

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_10_lung_infer_physicsnemo_mgn.py

Outputs
   One predicted surface and one warped CT per stage, and one animated USD
   across all of them, under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_10_lung_mgn/<case>/``.
   The acquired phase surface is rendered beside the prediction for visual
   comparison; scoring it is Tutorial 11's job.

Adapt to your data
   Change ``case_id`` to predict a different subject, or pass ``stages`` that
   were never acquired — which is the point of the surrogate. Omit
   ``reference_image`` to write meshes without warping anything. Use
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferPhysicsNeMo` on its own to get the raw
   target array when your model predicts something other than displacement.

Tutorial 11: Score the Surrogate Against the Images
===================================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_11_lung_evaluate_physicsnemo.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_11_duke_heart_evaluate_physicsnemo.py``

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowEvaluateMovement`, driving
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferMovement` and, for the lung variant,
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.SegmentNVSegmentCTMRI`.

Dataset
   The gated sequence itself — DIR-Lab for the lung, Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps for
   the heart — plus Tutorial 8's fitted surface and Tutorial 9's checkpoint for
   the held-out case.

Requirements
   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra. The lung variant also segments every gated frame
   on first run, so it needs a GPU and the segmentation weights; the labelmaps
   are cached, and a re-run skips them.

Preview
   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_11_lung_volumes.png

          output_directory=output_dir,
          evaluation_spacing_mm=2.0,
          report_dice=False,
      )

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_11_lung_evaluate_physicsnemo.py

Outputs
   ``evaluation_report.md``, ``evaluation_metrics.csv`` and
   ``volume_vs_stage.png`` under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_11_lung/<case>/``,
   carrying volume difference and surface RMSE per lobe at every gated stage;
   the duke variant adds Dice per chamber. The plot traces each structure's
   acquired and predicted volume across the stages. Report and CSV both record
   the hold-out case name, its shape parameters, and the network weights path
   with its dates, so a number can be traced back to the run that produced it.

   The lung variant passes ``report_dice=False``. Dice is an overlap fraction,
   so a lobe that moves a few millimeters against its own bulk scores over 0.96
   however well or badly the motion is predicted; the column would describe the
   lobe rather than the model. Chambers change shape enough over a heartbeat for
   it to discriminate, so the duke variant keeps it.

Adapt to your data
   Change ``LOBE_LABEL_IDS`` (or ``HEART_LABEL_IDS``) to score a different set
   of structures — any label your segmenter writes and your reference frame
   contains. Raise ``evaluation_spacing_mm`` if the deformation fields do not
   fit in memory; lower it to resolve a thin wall, at the cost of its cube.

Tutorial 12: The Whole Inference Pipeline in One Script
=======================================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_12_lung_end_to_end_inference.py``

   ``tutorials/tutorial_12_duke_heart_end_to_end_inference.py``

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowConvertImageToVTK` (lung) or
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.ContourTools` (heart),
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient`, then
   :meth:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferMovement.process_time_series`.

Dataset
   The gated sequence alone — DIR-Lab for the lung, Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps for
   the heart — plus the Tutorial 6 shape model and the Tutorial 9 checkpoint.
   Unlike Tutorial 10, nothing is read from Tutorial 8: this script fits the
   model to the patient itself, so the chain from image to animation runs in one
   place.

Requirements
   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra. The output directory is emptied at the start of
   every run, so nothing is reused and the reported runtimes are the whole
   pipeline's. Neither variant registers a phase — that is what the network
   replaces, and it is why this runs in minutes where Tutorial 8 runs in hours.

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_12_lung_end_to_end_inference.py

Outputs
   Under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_12_lung/<case>/`` (or
   ``tutorial_12_duke_heart``): the patient's fitted
   ``<case>_ssm_surface.vtp`` and ``<case>_ssm_pca_coefficients.json``, one
   predicted ``*_pred.vtp`` surface and one ``*_warped.mha`` volume per stage,
   ``<case>_mgn_motion.usd`` animating the whole cycle, and
   ``<case>_runtimes.csv`` timing each step of the run.

Adapt to your data
   Point the script at any case of the same cohort by changing ``case_id``; the
   stages come from the filenames, so a sequence with a different number of
   phases needs no other change. To predict stages the acquisition never
   sampled, pass your own ``stages`` list — the network is continuous in stage,
   and nothing downstream requires a matching image.

Tutorial 13: Breathe and Beat a Static Clinical CT
==================================================

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferMovement` over both Tutorial 9 networks,

   and :class:`~physiotwin4d.ConvertVTKToUSD` with
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.USDAnatomyTools` for the animation.

Dataset
   ``data/Chest-CT/Chest-CT.mha``, one ungated breath-hold scan, plus Tutorial 7
   (lung)'s fit of it and both Tutorial 9 checkpoints. No 4D acquisition is

   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra, and Simpleware Medical for the heart
   segmentation. Both segmentations and the heart fit are cached, so a re-run
   goes straight to inference. Budget disk: 100 combined frames, each with its
   own warped CT and labelmap, come to roughly 43 GB.

Preview

      :alt: Combined heart and lung surface motion on a static clinical CT
      :width: 90%

      ``heart_and_lung_motion.usd``: one ungated breath-hold scan, breathing and
      beating at once, with every deformation coming from a network and none
      from a registration.

   .. figure:: assets/tutorial_13_combined_motion_ct.gif
      :alt: The static CT warped by the same combined heart and lung motion
      :width: 90%

      The same per-frame deformation applied to the CT itself — the voxels move
      with the surfaces, so the scan breathes and beats along with them.

Inner API usage
   .. code-block:: python

      infer = WorkflowInferMovement(
          WorkflowInferPhysicsNeMo(model_directory=lung_model_dir)
      )
      # "forward" moves mesh vertices; "inverse" is what resampling an image
      # into the stage's frame needs.
      field = infer.create_deformation_field(
          shape_parameters=lung_coefficients_file,
          stage=0.0,
          reference_image=patient_image,
          fitted_reference_mesh=lung_fitted_reference_mesh_file,
          direction="forward",
      )
      transform = TransformTools().smooth_deformation_field_transform(
          field["deformation_field"], 15.0, field["weight_image"]
      )

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_13_heart_and_lung_motion.py

Outputs
   Under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_13_heart_and_lung/``: one 4D USD per rhythm
   (``breathing_lungs.usd``, ``beating_heart.usd``), 100 combined frames as VTP
   plus ``heart_and_lung_motion.usd`` split by anatomy and painted with organ
   materials, and the CT and labelmap warped by the same per-frame deformation.

Adapt to your data
   Point ``patient_image_file`` at your own chest CT and rerun Tutorial 7 (lung)
   on it to get the lung fit; the heart fit happens inside this script. Change
   ``cardiac_cycles_per_phase`` to re-time the heartbeat against the breath, and
   the two ``*_sigma_mm`` values to change how far each rhythm's surface motion
   is carried into the surrounding tissue.

Tutorial 14: Sweep the Shape Parameters
=======================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_14_lung_shape_parameter_sweep.py`` (DIR-Lab)

   ``tutorials/tutorial_14_duke_heart_shape_parameter_sweep.py``
   (Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps)

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowInferPhysicsNeMo` driving
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.InferPhysicsNeMoMGN`, scored by
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowEvaluateMovement` once per grid point.

Dataset
   The held-out case of Tutorial 9, plus its Tutorial 8 fit and the Tutorial 9
   checkpoint.

Requirements
   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra plus ``torch-geometric``, a GPU, and the
   segmentation weights --- every grid point is scored against independently
   segmented frames, exactly as Tutorial 11 scores its one fit.

What it does
   Tutorial 11 scores the inferred motion at the one point in shape space the
   statistical-model fit happened to land on. This tutorial sweeps that point:
   it perturbs the first few PCA coefficients over a grid, re-infers the whole
   cycle at every combination, and scores each the way Tutorial 11 scores its
   single fit.

   Only the coefficients handed to the network change. The reference anatomy
   stays the Tutorial 8 fitted surface at every grid point, so what the
   perturbation moves is the displacement field the MeshGraphNet infers, not
   the patient's own shape. The sweep therefore isolates the network's
   sensitivity to its shape conditioning. Because the reference surface, the
   reference labelmap and the acquired frames are identical across the grid,
   every combination is scored on the same evaluation grid and the figures are
   directly comparable point to point.

   The all-zero combination is in the grid, so the unperturbed score comes out
   of the same code path as every perturbed one.
   ``number_of_modes_to_vary``, ``perturbation_range`` and
   ``perturbation_step`` set the grid; the default is ``5 ** 2 = 25``
   combinations, each costing one Tutorial 11 run.

   Read the sweep by the displacement columns rather than by Dice: a perturbed
   coefficient can leave a structure the same size in the same place and still
   move every point of it wrong, which the labelmap metrics cannot see.

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      python tutorials/tutorial_14_lung_shape_parameter_sweep.py

      python tutorials/tutorial_14_duke_heart_shape_parameter_sweep.py

Outputs
   Under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_14_<anatomy>/<case>/``:
   ``shape_sweep_metrics.csv`` with one row per combination, stage and
   structure, ``shape_sweep_summary.csv`` with one row per combination carrying
   that combination's pooled displacement error, and one ``combo_<NNN>/``
   directory per grid point holding its own Tutorial 11 style report,
   predicted surfaces and warped labelmaps.

Adapt to your data
   ``number_of_modes_to_vary``, ``perturbation_step`` and
   ``evaluation_spacing_mm`` are the cost knobs --- the grid is exponential in
   the first. Point ``case_id`` at a different subject to sweep that one
   instead.

Tutorial 15: Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation
===========================================

Script
   ``tutorials/tutorial_15_lung_leave_one_out.py`` (DIR-Lab)

   ``tutorials/tutorial_15_duke_heart_leave_one_out.py``
   (Duke-Heart-4DLabelmaps)

Workflow
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowCreateMeanSurface` and
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowCreateStatisticalModel` per fold,
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowFitStatisticalModelToPatient` per case,
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowTrainPhysicsNeMo` driving
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.TrainPhysicsNeMoMGN`, and
   :class:`~physiotwin4d.WorkflowEvaluateMovement` on the held-out case.

Dataset
   The whole cohort, and nothing else. Tutorials 6, 8 and 9 outputs are reused
   as a cache when they are present, but every fold builds its own shape model,
   its own fits and its own network.

Requirements
   The ``[physicsnemo]`` extra plus ``torch-geometric``. Written for a
   multi-GPU Linux host, though it runs as a single process too.

What it does
   Tutorials 6 through 11 report accuracy for one fixed held-out case, which is
   a single observation: it says nothing about how far the number would move
   had a different patient been held out. This tutorial runs that chain once
   per fold. Each fold rebuilds the PCA model from the population *without* its
   held-out case, refits the cohort to that model, retrains the MeshGraphNet on
   the other cases, infers the held-out case at every acquired stage, and scores
   it against that stage's own ground truth. Rebuilding is the point --- a model
   built once from everyone has already seen every case, so scoring against it
   measures recall rather than generalization.

   ``number_of_leave_one_out_runs`` near the top of each script sets the fold
   count and defaults to 5.

   Two things do not depend on which case is held out --- the segmentations
   and, for the lung, the phase-to-reference image registrations --- so they
   are computed once into ``shared/`` and reused. Hoisting the registrations is
   what makes the lung variant tractable. The Duke variant cannot hoist its
   frame registrations: they warp the fold's own fitted surface, which changes
   with the fold, so a Duke fold costs materially more than a lung one.

Run
   .. code-block:: bash

      # One process
      python tutorials/tutorial_15_lung_leave_one_out.py
      python tutorials/tutorial_15_duke_heart_leave_one_out.py

      # Data-parallel training and rank-split per-case loops
      torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 \
          tutorials/tutorial_15_lung_leave_one_out.py
      torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 \
          tutorials/tutorial_15_duke_heart_leave_one_out.py

Outputs
   Under ``tutorials/output/tutorial_15_<anatomy>/``: ``loo_metrics.csv`` with
   every metric row of every fold, ``loo_report.md`` with the per-structure mean
   and standard deviation across folds, ``loo_metrics_by_label.png`` as the
   matching box plot, and one ``fold_<case>/`` directory per fold holding that
   fold's shape model, fits, manifests, weights and evaluation.

Adapt to your data
   Raise ``number_of_leave_one_out_runs`` to the cohort size for a full
   leave-one-out study; the runtime is linear in it. ``epochs`` and
   ``batch_size`` mirror Tutorial 9 so each fold's network is comparable to the
   one that tutorial trains --- lower them for a quicker sweep, at the cost of
   comparability.
