Frequently Asked Questions about PhysioTwin4D.

General Questions
=================

What is PhysioTwin4D?
-----------------------

PhysioTwin4D is a collection of methods, workflows, tutorials, and CLI tools for
creating personalized physiological digital twins: starting from a 3D medical
image of a subject, extracting anatomic models, and then using AI surrogates to
estimate the subject's physiological processes (initially cardiac and
respiratory motion, expanding to electrophysiology, blood flow, and organ
perfusion).

What data formats are supported?
---------------------------------

* **Input**: NRRD, MHA, NIfTI, DICOM
* **Output**: USD (Universal Scene Description), VTK

Do I need NVIDIA Omniverse?
----------------------------

Omniverse is the recommended way to view the USD scenes: its RTX renderer is
what evaluates the material properties assigned to each tissue. See
:doc:`viewing_meshes`. For the intermediate results you can also use:

* PyVista, for the intermediate ``.vtp`` / ``.vtu`` meshes
* ParaView, likewise for the VTK files

Installation Questions
======================

Do I need a GPU?
----------------

No. A plain ``pip install physiotwin4d`` works without a GPU. At import time
a ``UserWarning`` is emitted (visible by default in all standard Python runs):

.. code-block:: text

   CuPy is not installed — GPU acceleration is unavailable and processing will be
   slow. Re-install with uv to get CuPy and CUDA-enabled PyTorch in one step
   (pip alone will not select the correct CUDA wheel):
     uv pip install --torch-backend cu130 'physiotwin4d[cuda13]'  # CUDA 13

CPU-only mode is suitable for evaluation and small datasets. For production
workloads an NVIDIA GPU is strongly recommended.

Which CUDA version is required?
--------------------------------

CUDA 13 and CUDA 12.6 are supported through mutually exclusive extras. Use
CUDA 13 for R580-series drivers or newer, and CUDA 12.6 for older supported
Linux drivers such as R560 and R565:

.. code-block:: bash

   uv pip install --torch-backend cu130 "physiotwin4d[cuda13]"
   # Older Linux driver:
   uv pip install --torch-backend cu126 "physiotwin4d[cuda12]"

The extras install the matching CuPy package. ``--torch-backend`` explicitly
selects the corresponding ``cu130`` or ``cu126`` PyTorch wheel index for
published installs. Source checkouts also declare these mappings in
``pyproject.toml``.

What Python version is required?
---------------------------------

Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 are supported.

The floor is set by the optional ``[physicsnemo]`` extra: ``nvidia-physicsnemo``
supports >= 3.11, < 3.14, and the AI-surrogate tutorials need it. The rest of
the library would run on 3.10, but declaring 3.10 would promise an install
that cannot resolve that extra.

Usage Questions
===============

How long does processing take?
-------------------------------

Typical processing time for 10-frame cardiac CT (with GPU):

* 4D to 3D conversion: ~1 minute
* Registration: ~5-10 minutes
* Segmentation: ~1-2 minutes
* USD creation: ~1 minute
* **Total**: ~10-15 minutes

Which segmentation method should I use?
----------------------------------------

* **TotalSegmentator**: Fast, good quality, general purpose
* **Simpleware**: Best quality for cardiac imaging, requires Simpleware Medical
* **NV-Segment-CTMR**: CT *and* MRI, 345 classes; weights are licensed for
  non-commercial academic research only

See :doc:`api/segmentation/index` for comparison.

Which registration method should I use?
----------------------------------------

* **Greedy**: CPU-capable classical deformable registration; what Tutorials 1
  and 3 use by default
* **ICON**: Recommended for cardiac/lung (fast, GPU), and finetunable on your
  own cohort — see Tutorial 2
* **ANTs**: Best for brain imaging and general purpose
* **Greedy+ICON** (``RegisterImagesGreedyICON``, a ``RegisterImagesChain``
  preset): Greedy for the coarse alignment, ICON for the refinement

See :doc:`api/registration/index` for comparison.
